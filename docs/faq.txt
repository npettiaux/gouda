### "Why write another documentation processing program?" ###

Please see the [rationale page](rationale.html).


### "Why use Markdown? Why not LaTeX, reST, moinmoin wiki syntax, etc?" ###

The main focus of Gouda is to be a very *simple and easy* way to
create your docs (and to make them available). No manual
required. From *zero* to *docs* in no time flat. Markdown is, IMO, the
easiest of the markup formats to write, to read, and to remember, and
pandoc-markdown tastefully adds what's missing from original Markdown.



### "But my favorite language uses $markup!" ###

Documentation often benefits greatly when *others* also contribute to
it. The best writers may not know your markup format of choice, and
may not be interested in taking the time to learn it. But they very
likely already know Markdown (or can learn it in 5 minutes).



### "But Gouda is written in Python! My project uses $language-x!" ###

Gouda is a fairly simple script (contained in one file) which happens
to be written in Python but could easily be translated into just about
any other scripting language.

Under the hood, Gouda uses [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)
to do the heavy lifting. Although Pandoc can translate between various
markup formats, Gouda is only using it to convert Markdown to
HTML. There are many other Markdown implementations that you could use
if you wanted to (a bunch are listed at [the Markdown
wiki](http://xbeta.org/wiki/show/Markdown) and the [Markdown Wikipedia
page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)), though they might not
have the enhancements that Pandoc provides.



### "Why use Pandoc under the hood? Why not $my-favorite-markdown-implementation?" ###

Because Pandoc:

  * supports tables and definition lists
  * works great and is actively maintained
  * supports the command-line options that Gouda requires
  * is fast
  * is easy to install on Ubuntu GNU/Linux (`sudo apt-get install pandoc`)


### "I don't like Gouda's default output style. Can I change it?" ###

Certainly. `:)`

When you first run Gouda, it creates a default styles.css file which
you can then modify.
